---- In depth descriptions ----

-- Users --
Users need several different design features:
1) A way to move around map and intiate interaction with objects
2) A collection of attributes and a way of advancing these
3) A personal inventory of items and money, and a way of adding/removing these
4) A way of accessing trading facility.
5) A way of accessing battle facility.
6) A way of sending messages to other users - i.e. to discuss possible trades or alliances etc.

-- Map and rooms --
The game map would probably be composed of different rooms. Features for this would include
1) A way to load/create the map and rooms initially
2) A way for certain locations in room to have objects there, and spawn them

-- Monsters --
Monsters could be treated several ways:
1) Like users, but with moves randomly chosen at each step
2) Randomly spawning at certain locations when a user is there
In the case of 2), monsters would still need attributes/items etc and know how to fight

-- Items --
Items would fall into different subclasses. Broadly they would be:
1) In-battle items - Weapons/Shields/Armour etc
2) Out-of-battle items - money, maps, notes, trinkets etc
3) General items - healing potions etc

For each of these there are type specific considerations:
1) In-battle items need to have data that players fighting mechanisms can use to determine
   relative move strengths etc. Also need meessages that describe the action in battle if used
2) Out-of-battle items would properties that link them to quests

All items would need to have a value (in the case of selling them) and a description that can be
accessed fro the users inventory menu to inform them of it's use/effects/lore etc.

-- Battle facility --
- A battle facility would need mechanics to accept two characters (user or monster) that prompts
the character to supply moves etc.
- It would need a user interface that is presented to screen and allows user thread to interact with system.
- It would need a turn based system, tracking who's move it is.
- When the user selects a move, the users battle facilities calculate damage etc and supply data to battle system.
  Therefore in reality, facility should merely facilitate turn based activity and a way to pass messages between the two
  characters battle systems, and display this to screen

-- Trading facility --
- Similar to battle system.
- Should accept 2 users who wish to trader and facilitate message passing between them.
- Should be turn based: First user can select item they wish to trade and a price.
  	    	 	Second user can accept or offer a different price.
			First user can accept or offer a....
- Should be able to call user functions that relenquish items/gold and accept items/gold

-- Log on/off facility --
- This would be the first process initiated when a user connects to game server.
- Would prompt user for username and password.
- Searches database of all usernames and password and if finds match, creates player thread
- Else can create new account.
- Either way, creates a thread for the user and their playing begins

-- Graphics facility --
- This would be directly what the user would see at any moment in time
- Should access map which is stored in memory somehow
- Based on what's in each position, certain graphics are drawn.
- Always renders what is around user, say a 50x50 grid with user at centre
- Displays on RHS maybe player stats - health, level, items etc
